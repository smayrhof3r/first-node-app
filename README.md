# first-node-app

I'm keen to expand my skillset by learning Node / React, so have just started the Udemy course [Complete Guide to Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)

As the course progresses, I hope to be adding more meaningful projects. For now, I'm just learning the basics! ‚≠ê

Covered in this app:
- Running a js file using node command
- require('fs') function to bring in file system functionality
- fs.fileWriteSync(_filepath_, _file contents_) method for writing contents to a file on the hard drive
